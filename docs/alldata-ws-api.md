# AllDataÂ® Web Services API Specifications

## Overview

This document describes the web services API usage of the Fiserv AllData application. A RESTful API web service handles communication between the partner application and Fiserv, using HTTP protocol over SSL/TLS as the communication medium.

To extract data from Fiserv, the partner application sends a request with certain partner-identifying parameters and user authentication tokens. Upon receipt, the Fiserv server performs the requested task and responds with the results.

The AllData application supports two data formats: XML and JSON. Please contact your AllData sales representative for a link to the updated JSON schema/sandbox testing environment for the web services.

The AllData system provides web service access to:

- add financial institution (&quot;FI&quot;) seed data
- add, delete, and manage users
- add, delete, and manage user accounts with the FIs
- harvest user account information daily and on demand
- retrieve various kinds of transactions to provide accurate and up-to-date information about user assets and holdings

## AllData Service Integration

This section describes the different partner integration options with the AllData system.

### Full API WS Integration

In this model, RESTful web services APIs handle the complete flow from user registrations to data pull and account management. Partners develop custom user interfaces for account setup and management using the web services. Partners can invoke the web services using XML or JSON requests. Partners can also sign up for optional nightly batch files that allow AllData to push data.

### UI Widgets and API Integration

Please see the [Next-Gen Widgets Integration Guide](?path=/docs/alldata-next-gen.md) available on Developer Studio. 

## Full API Web Service Integration

In this model, partners do not use the AllData UI for account setup and management. Instead, partners develop custom user interfaces that communicate with AllData using web service APIs. The following is a list of the different categories of APIs available in the AllData system, each with a brief description.

- **User management:** APIs that support activities to manage users
- **External FI seed data:** APIs for partners to fetch information about FI data sources
- **Account management:** APIs to support user account management activities like user creation
- **Account harvesting:** APIs to allow periodic and on-demand retrieval of user account details
- **Account data management:** APIs to allow clients to retrieve user account data from AllData
- **Client management:** APIs to manage activities related to client-advisor relationships
- **Transaction categorization:** APIs to support transaction categorization

### User Management

AllData user management APIs support various activities to manage users. Partners use the Add User API to add one or more users to the AllData platform. The API expects typical user profile information such as name and address. Once AllData adds a user to its database, it returns a unique CEUserID that must persist in the partner database. The ID accompanies any user actions with AllData.

The following diagram details the typical add user process.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-02.png" alt="Figure 2"/>

The User Management module uses the following web services:

- createUser
- deleteUser
- getUserProfile
- updateUserProfile
- updateUserPassword

### Initial Financial Institution List Setup

As part of the initial integration with AllData, partners must fetch a list of institutions Fiserv supports and store it in their systems using the web services. After this initial load, subsequent synchronizations fetch only newly added and updated institution data.

**Note:** The AllData FI list has thousands of entries. Given the size of the list, we recommend that partners batch getFIDetails calls, with a limit of 500 FIs returned per call. This process should be executed server to server, taking into consideration that the fetch times may be longer and should not abort with a short timeout.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-03.png" alt="Figure 3"/>

### Periodic Maintenance Refresh

Partners should check for new and updated institution data daily by passing the current time and previous refresh time to obtain the delta. The following diagram represents this periodic data maintenance process.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-04.png" alt="Figure 4"/>

### External FI Seed Data

The following APIs are involved in external FI seed data management:

- getFinancialInstInfo
- searchFinancialInst

### External FI Messages (Special Instructions)

After fetching the supported institutions, partners must retrieve and store &quot;FI Messages&quot; (special instructions) associated with some institutions. Special instructions include actions users must perform before adding accounts. For example, some institution websites require users to provide consent to allow third-party aggregators to harvest account information; special instructions from such an institution would contain the user action to provide consent on its website.

After the initial load, partners perform periodic synchronizations that fetch only new and updated FI Message data.

The API used to fetch FI Messages is getFIMessageInfo.

### Add External Account (Held Away Accounts)

AllData account management APIs support activities required to aggregate a user&#39;s externally held (&quot;held away&quot;) accounts. Using the FI seed data and user login credentials, Fiserv fetches the user accounts at a given FI. The user chooses the specific accounts to aggregate and monitor, then Fiserv persists and updates the account information on a nightly basis. Partners can also refresh these accounts on demand.

#### Add Account workflow (without multi-factor authentication)

Partners use the following steps to add new accounts without multi-factor authentication (MFA). (See the [next section](#add-account-workflow-with-multi-factor-authentication) for the same process with MFA.) Partners should cache the FI seed data daily before calling these web services.

1. **initiateAddAccounts**

This step initiates the process of adding external accounts. This request triggers a harvesting request using HarvestAddRq with FI login parameters (username/password) or FILoginAcctId. AllData connects to the FI website and harvests account information. Refer to [Account Management Web Services](../api/?type=post&path=/WealthManagementWeb/ws/AccountMgmt/initiateAddAccounts) for the details of the API.

2. **getAddAccountStatus**

Invoke this API after the initiateAddAccounts request has started. It returns the status of InitiateAddAccounts. Invoke this API at a periodic interval to check the status. Refer to [Account Management Web Services](../api/?type=post&path=/WealthManagementWeb/ws/AccountMgmt/getAddAccountStatus) for the details of the API.

3. **getNewAccounts**

Invoke this API after the initiateAddAccounts request has completed. It returns the list of financial accounts found on the FI website. Currently these accounts are not created in the AllData system. Refer to [Account Management Web Services](../api/?type=post&path=/WealthManagementWeb/ws/AccountMgmt/getNewAccounts) for the details of the API.

4. **createAccounts**

Invoke this API to create the accounts in AllData system. Fiserv classifies the harvested accounts based on certain account classification rules. The user can either override this classification or provide the classification if not already set. After successfully adding accounts the partner must call update account APIs to run on-demand harvesting to retrieve account data. Refer to [Account Management Web Services](../api/?type=post&path=/WealthManagementWeb/ws/AccountMgmt/createAccounts) for API details. The following figure depicts the typical non-MFA Add Account workflow.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-05.png" alt="Figure 5"/>

#### Add Account workflow (with multi-factor authentication)

AllData system supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of the Add Account workflow which some FIs may require. AllData supports these with special handling of such accounts. When the first-time login credentials fail with MFA error (303 error code), AllData APIs fetch the MFA details (question or image) and present it to the partner. The partner provides the answer to the question on behalf of the user and the response is saved in the AllData system to access the user accounts in the future.

Below are the possible MFA scenarios.

- One text question, one text answer
- One text question, multiple text answers
- One image question, one text answer
- One image question, multiple image answers
- One text question, multiple image answers

The following are the changes the partner will implement for image-based MFA.

1. AllData will send the image ID in the FIMFAQuestions aggregate as part of the HarvestAddStsInqRs or HarvestStsInqRs.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-06.png" alt="Figure 6"/>

2. The partner calls a URL with the image ID generated in the previous step. The base64-encoded image is transmitted to the client browser using the HTTPS connection. See [Appendix C: MFA Image-Retrieving URL](?path=/docs/ws-api/appendices.md#appendix-c-mfa-image-retrieving-url) for the URL details. After decoding the payload, handle downloaded images in the Portable Network Graphics (.png) format.

**Note:** AllData provides an additional option to the partner to get the base64-encoded image in the HarvestAddStsInqRs or HarvestStsInqRs in lieu of image ID. Partners must contact the AllData team to turn on the property to send the actual image as part of the API request.

AllData sends the base64-encoded image in the FIMFAQuestions aggregate as part of the HarvestAddStsInqRs or HarvestStsInqRs.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-07.png" alt="Figure 7"/>

When an attempt to add or update account is already initiated, and while checking the status of the request, the multi-factor authentication flow described in the following diagram occurs.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-08.png" alt="Figure 8"/>

#### Add Account workflow (OAuth)

FIs are implementing OAuth (Open Authorization) protocol to secure their users&#39; sensitive information and to prevent their users&#39; credentials from falling into third-party hands. AllData supports OAuth authorization in the Add Account workflow.

Unlike the other Add Account workflows, partners perform the following steps for OAuth-enabled FIs instead of gathering users&#39; FI credentials.

1. **FIInfoRqRs**

The FIInfo is enhanced with a new element isOAuthFI to help partners determine whether the FI is OAuth-enabled. A value of &quot;True&quot; in this isOAuthFI element indicates the FI is OAuth-enabled.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-09.png" alt="Figure 9"/>

2. **initiateAddAccounts**

As in the standard approach to add new accounts, partners must invoke the initiateAddAccounts API to add accounts under OAuth-enabled institutions. The new parameter PartnerAppID is included in this API request and is a mandatory element when invoking the API to add accounts under OAuth-enabled institutions. Partners must send the PartnerAppID of the application from which the attempt is initiated and that PartnerAppID must be a registered one with the FI. Fiserv performs primary validation to confirm that the PartnerAppID is registered and returns an &quot;Invalid Partner Application ID&quot; response code if not registered (error code 4333). Partners must contact Fiserv to register any new application with the FI.

On invoking the initiateAddAccounts API request with the PartnerAppID, Fiserv sends back the response with the new aggregate OAuthInfo for the OAuth-enabled institutions.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-10.png" alt="Figure 10"/>

3. **getAddAccountStatus**

The partner shares the OAuthUrl to the user, who visits the institution-hosted site to provide login credentials and consent for the accounts to aggregate. Then the partner invokes the getAddAccountStatus API with the OAuthRqID that Fiserv sent in the initiateAddAccounts API response (instead of the RunID used in other Add Account workflows.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-11.png" alt="Figure 11"/>

After the user action at the institution site is complete and the institution sends the token to Fiserv to access user account information, Fiserv sends back the response to getAddAccountStatus with the HarvestID. Then the partner uses the HarvestID as the RunID to invoke getAddAccountStatus and continues polling the status.

After getAddAccountStatus returns a &quot;completed&quot; response, the partner continues with the regular Add Account workflow, invoking the getNewAccounts and createAccounts APIs to complete the add process. The update process for accounts owned by users who have completed the OAuth procedure for OAuth-enabled FIs is the same as the account update process for FIs that do not use OAuth.

If the token shared by the FI expires or becomes invalid, Fiserv marks the institution with error code 301 (Login failure â invalid login credentials) and expects the user to re-authorize at the institution-hosted site to get the new token. To clear the error, the partner must invoke the initiateAddAccounts API with the &#39;AddMoreAccounts&#39; option and include PartnerAppID. Fiserv sends a response with OAuthInfo and the partner follows the same steps above until getAddAccountStatus returns a &quot;completed&quot; response. Then the partner invokes the updateAccounts API to update the accounts and refresh their data.

The following diagram depicts the OAuth Add Account workflow.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-12.png" alt="Figure 12"/>

#### Delete Account workflow

To delete an account from AllData, partners invoke the Delete Account (FIDeleteRq) API on the AllData web services system when the account is deleted from the partner system.

This API is used to delete a connection to an FI established by the partner for a consumer (represented by FILoginAcctId) or a given financial account under that connection (represented by AcctId).

### Account Management

Account Management uses the following web services APIs:

- **initiateAddAccounts:** Partners call this API with client FI login parameters to establish a connection. AllData returns a HarvestID and RunID which the partner uses asynchronously to check the operation status.
- **getAddAccountStatus:** Partners use this API with RunID and HarvestID to poll the status of the initiateAddAccounts API.
- **getNewAccounts:** This API returns the list of accounts within an FI connection once successfully authenticated.
- **createAccounts:** Partners call this API with a list of accounts to be added to AllData for harvesting.
- **deleteAccounts:** Partners use this API to remove accounts from AllData for an FI connection, and the connection itself. Deleting the accounts removes all the harvested data from AllData. Deleting the FI connection (FILoginAcctId) removes all the accounts harvested within the FI, along with user credentials.
- **updateAccountCredentials:** If the user credentials for a stored connection change outside of AllData, partners call this API to update the stored credentials within AllData for an FI connection.
- **maintainAccount:** Partners use this API call to change account classifications, account nicknames, and so on.

### Harvest Account Data

Account Harvesting is a process that gathers the latest account information from the FI. There are two methods of update:

- Auto Update
- On-Demand Update

#### Auto Update

Auto Update is a process by which AllData updates all the accounts classified in automatic fashion on a nightly basis. AllData does not perform nightly updates for inactive users. Partners can elect to receive batch files on a customized schedule.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-15.png" alt="Figure 15"/>

#### On-Demand Update

Users trigger On-Demand updates manually to get the latest account information.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-16.png" alt="Figure 16"/>

The data refresh uses the following web services APIs:

- **updateAccounts:** This asynchronous API returns a RunID and a HarvestID. Partners use these values to poll for update status.
- **getHarvestStatus:** Partners use this API to poll the updateAccounts API call using RunID and HarvestID.

### Retrieve Account Data

Once the accounts are added to AllData system, the AllData engine automatically refreshes the accounts data nightly. The information gathered as part of harvesting is made available through web service APIs.

The transaction data pull APIs can be used to retrieve transactions for each account type and time period. The different transactions APIs are given below.

#### Banking transactions

The Banking transactions can be extracted from the AllData system for a certain time period using the getBankingTrans WS API. See [Account Data Pull APIs](../api/?type=post&path=/WealthManagementWeb/ws/AccountDataInq/getBankingTrans) for the details of the web service.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-17.png" alt="Figure 17"/>

#### Credit Card transactions

The Credit Card transactions can be extracted from the AllData system for a certain time period using the getCreditCardTrans WS API. See [Account Data Pull APIs](../api/?type=post&path=/WealthManagementWeb/ws/AccountDataInq/getCreditCardTrans) for the details of the web service.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-18.png" alt="Figure 18"/>

#### Investment transactions

The Investment transactions can be extracted from the AllData system for a certain time period using the getInvestmentTrans WS API. See [Account Data Pull APIs](../api/?type=post&path=/WealthManagementWeb/ws/AccountDataInq/getInvestmentTrans) for the details of the web service.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-19.png" alt="Figure 19"/>

#### Other Account transactions

The asset/liability/biller account transactions can be extracted from the AllData system for a certain time period using the getOtherAccountTrans WS API. See [Account Data Pull APIs](../api/?type=post&path=/WealthManagementWeb/ws/AccountDataInq/getOtherAccountTrans) for the details of the web service.

<img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiserv/alldata/develop/assets/images/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1/alldata-ws-api-specs-4.1-20.png" alt="Figure 20"/>

The account details and positions data pull APIs can be used to retrieve account summary and investment positions for each account type and time period.

Data pulls involve the following web services APIs:

- **getAccountsSummary:** This API returns metadata details for an individual account.
- **getAccountDetails:** This API returns a list of metadata for all harvested accounts within an FI connection.
- **getInvestmentTrans:** This API returns transaction details for an investment account.
- **getCreditCardTrans:** This API returns transaction details for a credit card account.
- **getBankingTrans:** This API returns transaction details for a banking account.
- **getOtherAccountTrans:** This API returns transaction details for liability accounts like billers, mortgages, loans, insurance, and other liability account types (except credit cards).
- **getInvestmentPos:** This API returns the investment positions within an investment account.
